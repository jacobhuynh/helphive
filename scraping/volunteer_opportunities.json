    "organizationDescription": "Our History University Community Social Services was founded in 1982 by two university professors who saw a great need among the many homeless people in their neighborhood. Together they started a temporary - or so they thought - soup kitchen open to anyone who needed sustenance. Over 25 years later, we’re still going strong, and the need is still great. Long ago, we figured out that meatloaf is a nourishing comfort food that makes a much better meal than soup. We make our meatloaf using an original recipe that we have perfected over the years. People love it, and we have come over time to be known as \"The Meatloaf People.\" Hunger doesn't take a vacation. Every week since our inception, through blackouts, heat waves, blizzards, and even the terrorist attack of 9-11, the kitchen has been there, serving literally hundreds of thousands of meals to needy New Yorkers. Our Philosophy We've learned that just as good food nourishes the body, respect nourishes the soul. Our soup kitchen was one of the first to seat and serve its guests with the courtesy one might find at a restaurant, as opposed to the traditional food line. Despite our name, we are not affiliated with any university nor are we associated with any religious organization. Our volunteers come from all walks of life, bound together only by our shared desire to lend a helping hand to those in need.",

Cuchifritos presents contemporary art exhibits featuring the work of emerging or under represented artists, and exhibits involving a clear conceptual theme structured to put the work of these artists in context.

    "organizationDescription": "Our StoryThe story of Louie’s Legacy started in 2006 when our founder Emily met a Basset Hound mix with red fur and different colored eyes living at a shelter with a 99% euthanasia rate. Not long after bringing him home, Louie was diagnosed with heartworm disease. Some suggested taking him back to the shelter, but Emily refused. Louie was more than just a pet. He brought joy into her life and gave her something to care about and love outside of herself. And in the process of healing Louie, she found that he healed her too. Emily soon realized the overwhelming number of shelter animals whose lives were cut short. Louie could have easily been the same. Instead, he became an incredible catalyst for her mission and the inspiration for Louie’s Legacy. Since then, we've saved thousands ofanimals and become one of the nation's largest foster-based rescues. Our goal is to save as many animals as possible and to expand our reach to help in even more areas, especially those that struggle with high populations of homeless and neglected animals.In 2021, we saved the lives of more than 3,200 animals thanks to the generosity of our volunteers, fosters and donors.",

    "organizationDescription": "The family court system lacks essential domestic violence training and disproportionately favors men over women, allowing alleged abusers to weaponize the court system and use the child as a pawn to perpetuate the torture of their ex partner, who is often punished for speaking out about the abuse. In a 2019 study conducted by George Washington University Law school professor Joan S. Meier, mothers, who reported child abuse, lost custody of their children to their abusers 30 to 50 percent of the time. Custody litigation can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and has depleted many families of the necessary resources to fight and protect the best interests of their children. High conflict custody cases further exacerbated by family court abuses and civil rights violations make finding competent legal counsel with expertise in this area that much more expensive and challenging. The stress of navigating a very dysfunctional family court system corrupted by special interests stacked against the protective mother and the safety and well-being of her child is traumatizing in and of itself, especially when that mother has just escaped an abusive partner and is now faced with the fear and possibility of losing her child to her abusive ex. Counseling and other therapeutic and supportive services by licensed mental health professionals are essential to helping these women validate their experiences, cope, heal, and maintain their emotional and psychological strength while combating a parent's worst nightmare.",

Our organization was founded to match underserved students across the United States with free online tutors to more safely help during this unprecedented crisis and beyond.Historically, students in underserved communities are at greater risk of falling behind in academics and socio-emotional skills. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating the plethora of academic and personal challenges these students already face. Our organization presents students in low-income communities with opportunities to strengthen subject comprehension and boost confidence. The needs, strengths, and voices of the impacted students drive our family-centered philosophy and evidence-based practices.Together with our partners, Pandemic Professors combats adverse effects on learning resulting from the pandemic and exacerbated by poverty. Students in underserved communities don’t lack a hunger for knowledge, they lack the means to access quality tutoring. Pandemic Professors provides effective tools for students to complete their K-12 education, and we will continue to work with our students after the pandemic until the educational gap is resolved. We sincerely hope you consider joining us in the fight to improve the lives of students adversely affected by poverty and the pandemic.",

Director Rick Whitaker had been an opera student at the University of Cincinnati College/Conservatory of Music but was defeated by extreme stage fright. He shifted to creative writing and moved to New York at the age of 20. (He has published three books.) But his experience as a student singing in choirs left a nagging desire in him to direct his own group. His day for more than 20 years has been producing concerts at Columbia University's Italian Academy, where he had access to a small theater. He pitched the choir to his executive director who approved his plan wholeheartedly. The idea is simple: a group for anyone to join who wants to practice choral singing.

He shifted to creative writing and moved to New York at the age of 20. (He has published three books.) But his experience as a student singing in choirs left a nagging desire in him to direct his own group. His day for more than 20 years has been producing concerts at Columbia University's Italian Academy, where he had access to a small theater. He pitched the choir to his executive director who approved his plan wholeheartedly. The idea is simple: a group for anyone to join who wants to practice choral singing.

Exercise, and especially exercise done toward a goal and with a team, has been clinically proven to promote the mindset needed to stay sober and reduce the risk of relapse. Training for this role will include an overview of the causes and treatment for addiction, with an emphasis on the physical, emotional, and mental health benefits of exercise in early recovery.The first-year post-addiction treatment relapse rate is 40-60%, and since the pandemic, the number of overdose deaths has been climbing. You will be part of bringing those numbers down! Together, we will support recovery. Together, we will change lives.",

Formally incorporated in 2009 by Dr. Edgar Chavez, Chief Executive Officer, Universal Community Health Center (UCHC) is a non-profit (501(c)(3) Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) serving families in South Los Angeles. In 2010, UCHC became an FQHC look alike, and in 2015 opened its second clinic, the San Pedro site. In 2017, UCHC became a HRSA deemed grantee, and in 2018 updated its scope of services to include Behavioral Health. UCHC has since expanded to operate six (6) health center locations and a mobile health clinic. Mission- To provide quality and accessible healthcare to under-served communities and to provide a patient centered model of care to empower communities towards wellness. Vision- Comprehensive Care for all UCHC’s service delivery model provides comprehensive services across all life cycles with a focus on prevention and empowerment of patients to take charge of their health and to lead healthier lifestyles. Services include primary and behavioral health care, including health screenings, family planning, gynecological care, and well-child visits. In addition, UCHC strives to assist its patients with practical arrangements for additional and supporting services including transportation, translation, referrals for primary and specialty care, case management, remote patient monitoring, chronic disease management for diabetes and hypertension, and assistance with understanding and adhering to provider-recommended care plans. And more recently, UCHC offers Covid-19 testing and vaccinations. UCHC continues to be based on meeting the specific healthcare needs of South LA, which includes residents of disadvantaged communities with many barriers to accessing services. Furthermore, linguistically appropriate service is a priority at UCHC. Spanish/English speaking staff members are actively recruited for each area of health center operations, and local residents are hired whenever possible. The vast majority of clinic staff live within our service area. Universal Community Health Center’s service area encompasses more than 1.15 million residents and more than 306,000 households. Though UCHC grew exponentially in 2020, providing for preventative, routine medical care and the urgent needs of community members most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, tremendous unmet need still remains a threat to our collective wellbeing. Understanding that physical health, mental health, and a high quality of life are interrelated aspects of a person’s overall wellbeing, UCHC has forged extensive relationships with a growing network of service providers in the community which are critical to effective comprehensive care. UCHC is an authorized provider of several public programs including: Child Health and Disability Program (CHDP), Comprehensive Perinatal Service Program (CPSP), Family Pact for family planning. These partners and services include the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. Other community partners and services include the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program,employment services, housing services, food assistance, domestic violence services, substance abuse and recovery programs; senior programs; regional centers; family resource centers, and a variety of other social service organizations.",

    "organizationDescription": "We are in need of consistent and caring volunteers for our Academic enrichment programs. Our tutoring and mentoring programs provide essential academic and social/career support to school aged youth. In our tutoring program we partner youth up with a volunteer that meets with them one to three hours a week (depending on youth need and tutor availability) Mondays through Thursdays after school. The program runs across the school year and we ask that volunteers can commit to a minimum of once a week for an hour for at least one semester. Our mentoring program also partners our youth with an adult volunteer to help them through academic and social challenges including career direction, peer pressure etc - there is a curriculum that our staff use to lightly guide the conversations. Our mentors and mentees meet once a week on Tuesdays at 4pm for an hour. We similarly ask that volunteers are available for atleast one semester in the year - preferably the whole year. Volunteers do not need to be teachers or educators but we prefer they are passionate about helping youth and are able to converse with youth and can be patient with youth who are not used to speaking up and exploring their future possibilities.",

    "organizationDescription": "At Pandemic Professors, we believe all K-12 students deserve an opportunity to receive free supplemental learning through private tutoring, in order to help them remain on track and meet their educational goals. Our organization was founded to match underserved students across the United States with free online tutors to more safely help during this unprecedented crisis and beyond.Historically, students in underserved communities are at greater risk of falling behind in academics and socio-emotional skills. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating the plethora of academic and personal challenges these students already face. Our organization presents students in low-income communities with opportunities to strengthen subject comprehension and boost confidence. The needs, strengths, and voices of the impacted students drive our family-centered philosophy and evidence-based practices.Together with our partners, Pandemic Professors combats adverse effects on learning resulting from the pandemic and exacerbated by poverty. Students in underserved communities don’t lack a hunger for knowledge, they lack the means to access quality tutoring. Pandemic Professors provides effective tools for students to complete their K-12 education, and we will continue to work with our students after the pandemic until the educational gap is resolved. We sincerely hope you consider joining us in the fight to improve the lives of students adversely affected by poverty and the pandemic.",

Joseph understood at an early age, that often times good people fall on hard times and due to unforeseen circumstances can find themselves homeless and needing assistance. We want to make a real lasting difference in this world by strengthening communities and dedicating real time and efforts towards this epidemic of homelessness. Also, there is a strong need for mentor-ship programs in these same communities as families can be broken apart for various reasons and children miss the opportunity to have a positive role model speak greatness into their lives.

Our organization was founded to match underserved students across the United States with free online tutors to more safely help during this unprecedented crisis and beyond.Historically, students in underserved communities are at greater risk of falling behind in academics and socio-emotional skills. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating the plethora of academic and personal challenges these students already face. Our organization presents students in low-income communities with opportunities to strengthen subject comprehension and boost confidence. The needs, strengths, and voices of the impacted students drive our family-centered philosophy and evidence-based practices.Together with our partners, Pandemic Professors combats adverse effects on learning resulting from the pandemic and exacerbated by poverty. Students in underserved communities don’t lack a hunger for knowledge, they lack the means to access quality tutoring. Pandemic Professors provides effective tools for students to complete their K-12 education, and we will continue to work with our students after the pandemic until the educational gap is resolved. We sincerely hope you consider joining us in the fight to improve the lives of students adversely affected by poverty and the pandemic.",
